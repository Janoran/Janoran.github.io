A unique version of the classic arcade game "Asteroids" made in Unity with C# for a school project.
There are lots of different looking asteroids as well as enemy spaceships which target you and spawn in waves.
At the end of all waves there's a boss who has way more health than the little spaceships before.
Another key feature of our asteroids was the shop in which you're able to buy upgrades to your gun and a shield which can be activated via right click and block any incoming damage from enemy bullets.
Explosions and blocked bullets were all animated using many sprites and the unity animator.
The handcrafted Soundtrack was made with FLStudio.
