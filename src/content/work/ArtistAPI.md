img_alt: Artist Client to get the data from an API
description: |
  I created an API which stores data for an Artist in a Database and gets called via a WPF and WebClient
tags:
  - API
  - MongoDB
  - WebClient
  - WPFClient
---

## API

The API ran on a nodejs express server hosted on the localhost of my personal computer.
The Database schema for the API was created with Mongoose

## WebClient

The Webclient was created with simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript and focused on displaying the data in cards as well as offering a search bar for filtering the cards by their artistname or a specific song

## WpfClient

Using C# and xaml files the Wpf Client was simple, yet effective and used as an admin tool to post and see the data from the Database
